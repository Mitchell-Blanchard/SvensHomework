1. Search the network and find all the machines that have winrm enabled.

2. Display all the machines that have winrm enabled in a gui (out-gridview)

3. Let users select the computers they want and pass that information back to powershell (-passthru)

4. Once the machines have been selected show the information for each machine in a gui for users to inspect

5. When the task is completed and information has been shown, ask the user if they would like to either:
	a) Find new machines
	b) Exit
	c) run a query on the remote machines

6. If the users would like to run a query on the remote machines, prompt with gui/text editor to write script to pass through to the remote machines
	a)show the results of the query on each machine in a gui
	b)ask to Find new machines or exit

	Bonus:
	a) ask for a file to be used for the scipt instead of having to write it out
	b) ask to run the script of additional machines
	c) review other information while scripts are running

Notes:
	Use functions for EVERYTHING
	Run things in the background while waiting
